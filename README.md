# Security+ Study Guide 🛡️

I'm currently studying for the Security+ certification, and this repository is my collection of notes, resources, and practice questions. Feel free to use this as a reference for your own studies


## Study Materials 🎓
### Notes 📒
- Primary Source: [Professor Messer’s YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.jp/watch?v=KiEptGbnEBc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv) – Majority of my notes came from Professor Messer! He explains each concept in bite sized (~5 minutes) videos. Great to watch if you're in a rush  
- Additional Notes: [My Notes](https://github.com/xrlps/Security-Plus-701-Notes) – Organized by topic for easier review.


### Practice Questions 📚
- [CompTIA’s Official Practice Questions](https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/comptia-security-practice-tests)
- [Exam premium](https://exampremium.com/comptia-security/)
- [CompTIA Exam Prep Application](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/comptia-security-exam-prep/id1501784033)
- [Professor Messer's practice exam](https://www.professormesser.com/sy0-701-success-bundle/) ($30 USD)


### Study Tips 👨‍🏫
- Watch Professor Messer's videos in full to grasp the basic concepts
- Take your own notes, or use mine for reference!
- Practice exam questions daily on the CompTIA Exam Prep app. For questions you find challenging, refer to your notes (or mine) rather than purchasing the subscription


### Setting up the notes 🧑‍🏫
- Because the notes are in a `.md` format, you can drop them into your favorite note taking application. I recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
