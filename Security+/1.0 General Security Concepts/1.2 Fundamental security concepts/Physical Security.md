## Fencing
- Using a fence to build a perimeter around an area
## Video surveillance
- CCTV
- Can replace physical guards; identify a license plate; identify a person's face
## Guards and access badges
- Security guard that validates identification
- Two-person integrity/control is used to minimize the exposure to an attack, so that no single person has access to a physical asset
- Access badges are used to electronically verify and log people, and they must be worn at all times
## Lighting
- Attackers will avoid light because a well lit area means more security (easier to see and record an attackers processes)
## Sensors
- Infrared
	- Can detect infrared radiation in light and dark or heat to see if an object is moving in an area
- Pressure
	- Detects a change in force
	- Usually in floor and window sensors
- Microwave
	- Detects movement across large areas
	- Detects the presence and movement of objects or people
	- Can penetrate walls
- Ultrasonic
	- Can detect motion, collision detection, etc
	- Use sound waves
	- Provide high precision for detecting objects
