## Confidentiality
- Only authorized users can access the systems information
- Data is encrypted so that only certain (authorized) users can read it
- Access controls are used to selectively restrict access to a resource
- Two factor authentication
## Integrity
- Messages cannot be modified as they traverse the network; they are accurate and unaltered
- Data is hashed on delivery and hashed on receipt. These two hash values are compared to see if the data was altered in transit
- Digital signatures can be used to verify the integrity of the data using encryption algorithms
- Digital certificates can be used to verify and individual
- **Non-repudiation** is used to provide a proof of integrity and source
## Availability
- Systems and networks are up and running for authorized users
- Through redundancy, fault tolerance, and/or patching
