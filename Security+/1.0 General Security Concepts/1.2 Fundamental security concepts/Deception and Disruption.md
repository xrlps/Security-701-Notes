## Honeypots
- Used to attract attackers (automated scripts) to a system, trapping to control an attack and understand how the attack works
- A virtual environment
#### Honeynets
- A large, deceptive network with one or more honeypots
- Simulates a real network with devices like servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and workstations
#### Honeyfiles
- Mock files that appear to have real information
- Bait for a honeynet (passwords.txt)
- Alerts are sent if the file is accessed (virtual bear trap)
#### Honeytokens
- Tracks malicious attackers by adding traceable data to the honeynet
- If data is stolen, verifying the source of the attacker is easy
- Placing out API credentials that alerts a system when used
