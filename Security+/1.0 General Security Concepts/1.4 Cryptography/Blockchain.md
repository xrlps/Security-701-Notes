- A distributed ledger that keeps track of transactions
- All users of the blockchain help maintain the ledger and all users have a copy of the ledger
- Used to track the following
	- Payment processing
	- Digital identification
	- Supply chain monitoring
	- Digital voting
## Process
- The transaction is sent to all the nodes in a **decentralized** network, to be verified
- The transaction is added to a larger **block** of transactions which contains other recently verified transactions
- A [[Hashing and Digital Signatures#Hashing|hash]] is calculated from the previous blocks of transaction data and is appended to the new block of verified transactions
- The ledger is updated with the newly added hash, and is sent to all nodes maintaining the ledger
- If a malicious (or failed node) attempts to alter a block, all other nodes will recognize that the blocks hash is invalid and will reject the change
