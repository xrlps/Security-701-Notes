- A combination of UPS and generators may both be used
	- A UPS may be used first to provide immediate convergence when a generator is still starting up. Once the generator is running, it will be used as the main power source
## Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
- Used for short-term power backup
- Used in
	- Blackouts - complete drop in power
	- Brownouts - drop in voltage
	- Surges - excess voltage
- Can only be used for a limited amount of time - limited batter capacity
#### Offline/standby UPS
- Constantly running on main power
- When the main power goes down, the UPS runs on its backup battery
#### Line-interactive UPS
- Can slowly increase voltage when sensing a drop in voltage (brownout)
#### On-line/Double-conversion UPS
- Always runs on its batter backup
## Generators
- Used for long-term power backup
- Requires fuel storage
