- Simulating an attack on a system; testing for vulnerabilities in-house or with a trusted third party so that attackers cannot attack these same vulnerabilities 
- Differs from [[Vulnerability Scanning]], in that the exploit is attempted
- Often a compliance mandate
	- Regular penetration testing by a third-party 
	- May be a legal requirement
## Rules of engagement
- A formal list of rules to define the scope and purpose of a penetration test
	- Location of test (physical, internal, external)
	- Time of test
- Defines the types of systems allowed to be tested
	- IP address ranges
	- Emergency contacts - if the test goes wrong
	- How to handle sensitive information
	- Systems in the scope of the test
## Exploiting vulnerabilities
- Try to break into the system
- If the [[Penetration Testing#Rules of engagement|rules of engagement]] are clearly defined and followed, the exploit should not disrupt running systems (that aren't being tested)
- May need to try different vulnerability types
	- Password brute-force
	- Social engineering
	- Database injections
	- [[Application Vulnerabilities#Buffer overflow|Buffer overflow]]
## Process
#### Initial exploitation
- Get into the network; finding an exploit to get access to a system
#### Lateral movement
- Moving from the exploited system to another system
- The inside of the network is relatively unprotected
#### Persistence
- Setting up a backdoor to get back into the system
	- Building user accounts
	- Changing or verifying passwords
#### The pivot
- Gain access to systems that would normally not be accessible
- Using a vulnerable system as a proxy or relay, through [[Penetration Testing#Lateral movement|lateral movement]]
## Responsible disclosure program
#### Bug bounty programs
- A reward for discovering vulnerabilities in a system
- Earn money for hacking a system
- Document the vulnerability
- A controlled information release
	1. Researcher reports the vulnerability
	2. Manufacturer creates a fix
	3. The vulnerability is announced publicly
