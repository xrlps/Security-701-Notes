- Often times, a reported vulnerability will be a false positive - a vulnerability that is identified that doesn't exist
- A vulnerability that exists but is not detected is a false negative
## Prioritizing vulnerabilities
- Refer to [public disclosures](http://nvd.nist.gov) and vulnerabilities to properly prioritize
	- Synchronized with the [[Analyzing Vulnerabilities#CVE|CVE]] list
#### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- Quantitative scoring of a vulnerability from 0 to 10 - 10 being vulnerable
#### CVE
- A standardized, [publicly available](https://cve.mitre.org/cve) database that provides unique identifiers and descriptions for known vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability scanners usually associate vulnerabilities with their well-known CVE
- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
	- Check manually if the system is vulnerable
## Vulnerability classification
- Vulnerability scanners can scan different types of systems, given their database of signatures
- Application scans
	- Desktop
	- Mobile apps
- Web application scans
	- Software on a web server
- Network scans
	- Misconfigured firewalls
	- Open ports 
	- Vulnerable devices
## Exposure factor
- The loss of value or business activity if the vulnerability is exploited 
- Expressed as a percentage
## Environmental variables
- Determining the environment associated with the vulnerability in order to follow a patching process and prioritize patching order
	- Internal servers, public cloud, test lab, etc
## Industry/organizational impact
- Different organizations are impacted differently by the same vulnerability
	- A hospitals data being held for ransom is different from a car manufacturers data held for ransom
## Risk tolerance
- The amount of risk acceptable to an organization
- How much risk an organization is willing to accept by having a vulnerability unpatched
	- Cost vs benefit
	- Operational impact
	- Time
