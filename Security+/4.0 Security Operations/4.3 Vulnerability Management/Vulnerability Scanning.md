- Used to *test* if a system is susceptible to a type of attack
- Minimally invasive
- Gathers as much information as possible - even redundant
## Network scans
- Scanning a network from inside and outside to determine any potential vulnerabilities such as:
	- Misconfigured DNS
	- Outdated OpenSSL
	- Weak encryption protocols
- Determine open ports on a system
- Determine active devices based on IP address scans
## Application scans
#### SAST
- Used to scan for vulnerabilities in the source code of an application
- See [[Application Security#Static code analyzer|Application Security]]
#### Fuzzing
- Sending random input into an application
- See [[Application Security#Input validation|Application Security]]
## Package monitoring
- Some applications are distributed in a package
- Confirm the package is legitimate
	- Trusted source
	- No added malware
	- No embedded vulnerabilities
