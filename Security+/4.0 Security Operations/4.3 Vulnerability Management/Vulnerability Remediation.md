## Types of remediation
#### Patching
- Updating systems to prevent or halt attacks
 - The most common [[Mitigation Techniques#Patching|mitigation techniques]]
#### Insurance
- Often used to "circumvent" ransomware attacks
- See [[Infrastructure Considerations#Risk transference|Infrastructure Considerations]]
#### Segmentation
- Limits the scope of an attack
- See [[Protecting data#Segmentation|Protecting data]]
- Through the use of
	- [[Network Infrastructure#Physical segmentation|Physical segmentation]]
	- [[Network Infrastructure#Logical segmentation (VLANs)|Logical segmentation]]
#### Compensating controls
- Used when optimal security methods are not available
	- Patches cannot be deployed
	- No internal firewalls
- Remediation in other ways
	- Disable the problematic service
	- Revoke access to the application
	- Limit external access
	- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls
- Provides coverage until a more optimal security response is available
## Exceptions and exemptions
- Weighing the pros and cons of patching a system and leaving it unpatched
- A formal process
## Validation of remediation
- Once remediated, ensuring that the vulnerability is now gone
- Rescanning
	- Performing extensive [[Vulnerability Scanning|vulnerability scans]]
- Audit
	- Performing audits to ensure the patch was successfully deployed
- Verification
	- Manually confirm the security of the system
## Reporting
- A reporting system is used to inform of patches pushed and the result of the patches
