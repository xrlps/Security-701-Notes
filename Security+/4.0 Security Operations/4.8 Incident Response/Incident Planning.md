## Exercising
- Testing before an actual event
	- Processes, procedures, technical skills, etc
- Schedules update sessions 
	- annual, semi-annual, etc
- Use well-defined rules of engagement - avoid touching the production system
- Test in a very specific scenario
- Evaluate, document, and discuss the response to the event
## Tabletop exercise
- See [[Recovery Testing#Tabletop exercise|Recovery Testing]] 
## Simulation
- See [[Recovery Testing#Simulation|Recovery Testing]]
## Root cause analysis
- Determining the ultimate cause of an incident by asking a "why" question
- Create a set of conclusions regarding the incident backed up by facts
- Looking at log files, information stored by the attacker
	- Use this data to essentially recreate the attack
- Can be more than one root cause
## Threat hunting
- Find the vulnerability before the attacker; find the attacker before they find you
- Using automated tools and monitoring systems
