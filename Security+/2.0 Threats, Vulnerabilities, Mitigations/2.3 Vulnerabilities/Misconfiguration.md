## Open permissions
- Devices with open access can be used to exfiltrate data or be used for reconnaissance attacks
## Unsecured admin accounts
- Easy to guess passwords to get access to administrator privileges
- To secure an admin account, disable direct login to the root and require a user to first log in with regular permissions, then log in as root
## Insecure protocols
- Protocols like Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, that send traffic over the internet as clear text should not be used
## Default settings
- IoT devices with default settings are susceptible to attacks
## Open ports and services
- The number of open ports should be limited
- For the open ports, a firewall should be applied to manage traffic flows
