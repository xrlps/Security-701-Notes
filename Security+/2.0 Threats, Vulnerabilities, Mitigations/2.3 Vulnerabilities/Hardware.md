-  IoT (Internet of Things) devices can introduce potential vulnerabilities because they connect to the network and operate on their own operating systems
- Since these devices are developed by a single vendor, the responsibility for addressing any threats typically falls to that one vendor
- Devices that reach their End of Life (**EOL**) are no longer being sold and may or may not be supported
- Devices that reach their End of Service Life (**EOSL**) are no longer sold and no longer supported
- **Legacy platforms** refers to the devices that may be running EOL software
