- A method used by an attack to gain access or infect a system
- Also called an **attack vector**
## Message-based vectors
- One of the most successful threat vectors
- Email, SMS
- [[Social Engineering Attacks#Phishing|Phishing]], [[Social Engineering Attacks#Smishing|smishing]] 
## Image-based vectors
- Malicious data embedded into images, typically SVG format, which is described in XML
	- Can cause HTML injection or JavaScript attack code
	- XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks
## File-based vectors
- A threat hidden into a file format containing other objects, like an Adobe PDF
- Threats in compressed files like ZIP/RAR
## Voice call vectors
- [[Social Engineering Attacks#Vishing|Vishing]], [[Social Engineering Attacks#Spam over IP|spam over IP]], [[Social Engineering Attacks#War dialing|war dialing]], [[Social Engineering Attacks#Call tampering|call tampering]]
## Removable device vectors
- Malicious software on USB flash drives
- Gets around firewalls
- USB drives can act as a keyboard
- Can get large amounts of data without using up bandwidth
## Vulnerable software vectors
- Client-based
	- An application has a known (or unknown) vulnerability that an attacker takes advantage of to get access to a system
- Agentless
	- Compromising a server the affect connecting clients
## Unsupported system vectors
- Older, unsupported systems, that connect to an organization may have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access data
## Unsecure network vectors
- Taking advantage of vulnerabilities in networks to view all (non-encrypted data)
- Wireless
	- Outdated security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2)
	- Open or rogue wireless networks
- Wired
	- Interfaces without 802.1X enabled
- Bluetooth
	- Reconnaissance attacks
## Open service ports
- Open server ports can be used to exploit the application's vulnerabilities to get access to a network
- More services = more open ports = less secure system
## Default credentials
- Using the default credentials on a system, like a device, router, application, etc
## Supply chain vectors
- A third party gets access to infrastructure by tampering with the underlying infrastructure
- During manufacturing process or during the delivery of a device, or supplying illegitimate devices
