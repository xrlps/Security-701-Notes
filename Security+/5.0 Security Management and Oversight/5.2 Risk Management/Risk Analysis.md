## Qualitative risk assessment
- Identifies business impact
- Identify all the most significant risk factors
	- Impact
	- Annualized rate of occurrence
	- Cost of controls
	- ...
- Ask opinions about the significance of each risk factor
- Displayed visually on a grid
## Quantitative risk assessment
- Identifies monetary impact
- Begins with an [[Risk Analysis#Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)|ARO]]
- Risks are assigned an [[Risk Analysis#Asset Value (AV)|AV]]
#### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
- How often a risk will occur in a single year
#### Asset Value (AV)
- The value of an asset to an organization; cost of the asset, effect on company sales, etc
#### Exposure Factor (EF)
- The percentage of the value lost due to an incident
- 1.0 - losing the entire asset. 0.5 - losing half the asset
#### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
- The monetary loss if a single event occurs
- [[Risk Analysis#Asset Value (AV)|AV]] x [[Risk Analysis#Exposure Factor (EF)|EF]]
	- i.e. Laptop stole = $1000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = $1000 (SLE)
#### Annualized Loss Expectancy
- [[Risk Analysis#Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)|ARO]] x [[Risk Analysis#Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)|SLE]]
	- i.e. 7 Laptops stolen per year = 7 (ARO) x $1000 (SLE)

## Impact considerations
- Life
- Property
- Safety
- Finance
## Likelihood and probability
#### Risk likelihood
- Qualitative measurement of risk
- Rare, possible, almost certain, etc
#### Risk probability
- Quantitative measurement of risk
- Statistical
- Can be based on historical performance
## Risk appetite and tolerance
- The amount of accepted risk an organization can take, before they attempt to reduce that risk
#### Risk appetite posture
- The amount of risk an organization is willing to take
#### Risk tolerance
- The amount of risk an organization is willing to endure
- An acceptable risk from the risk appetite
## Risk register
- A document that details the risks associated with a project
- Key risk indicators that could impact the organization
	- A risk owner is assigned to manage each risk indicator
- Risk threshold: the balance between running the project and the risks associated with the project
