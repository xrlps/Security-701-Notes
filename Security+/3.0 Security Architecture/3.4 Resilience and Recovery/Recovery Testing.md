- Testing the recovery plan to ensure reliability before an actual event
- Should be scheduled (annual, monthly, semi-annual, etc)
- Uses well-defined rules of engagement to prevent the altering of production systems
- Has a specific scenario with a limited time
- Response should be heavily documented and evaluated
## Tabletop exercise
- Going through the steps of disaster recovery rather than testing for an actual disaster
- Simulating a disaster without physically going through the drill
- A discussion of what and how the organization will go through a scenario
- Invite key players together for the exercise
## Fail over
- Testing the [[Resiliency|redundant]] systems
## Simulation
- Testing with a simulated event
	- Phishing attack
	- Password request
	- Data breaches to test logs
## Parallel processing
- Splitting processes through multiple, parallel, CPUs
	- Using multiple CPU cores or multiple physical CPUs
- Improves performance
- Improves recovery by spreading load to multiple processors
