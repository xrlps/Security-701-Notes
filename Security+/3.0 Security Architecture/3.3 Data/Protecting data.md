## Geographic restrictions
- Making policy decisions based on a users location
- A users location can be determined through [[Data States#Geolocation|Geolocation]]
- **Geofencing** refers to the policy decisions applied based on a users location
## Encryption
- Encoding data into an unreadable format
	- Original information is plaintext
	- The encrypted data is [[Encrypting data|ciphertext]]
- A two way trip - the encrypted data can be later decrypted with the associated [[Encrypting data|private key]]
- Used when data needs to be hidden but later retrieved
## Hashing
- Representing data as a short string of text, often called a message digest or [[Hashing and Digital Signatures|fingerprint]]
- A one-way trip - the encrypted data cannot be recovered
- Used to store passwords or verify [[Encryption and Integrity Methods|integrity]]
- Can be used to create [[Hashing and Digital Signatures|digital signatures]]
## Obfuscation
- The process of taking something understandable to something [[Obfuscation|difficult]] to read
	- Easy to read code turned into hard to read code
- Using [[Obfuscation#Data masking|data masking]], [[Obfuscation#Tokenization|tokenization]], etc
## Segmentation
- Rather than putting all data into a single area (like a single large database), segmenting data into different locations provides additional security
## Permission restriction
- Adding secure passwords, additional authentication factors, policies, and permission
